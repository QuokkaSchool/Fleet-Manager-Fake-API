# Fleet Manager (Fake API)

This project provides a hands-on experience for frontend developers eager to learn the ropes of working with APIs. Designed as a self-contained application, our simulator doesn't rely on external databases but instead operates with local variables.

## Introduction

### Features

- **Local Data Management:** No need for external databases; all data is managed locally.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for vehicles, drivers, and orders.
- **Pagination and Sorting:** Practice pagination, sorting, and filtering with ease.
- **Realistic Data:** Simulated data mimics real-world scenarios, offering practical experience.
- **Perfect for Learning:** Ideal for frontend projects, coding exercises, and educational purposes.
